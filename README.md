### Professional Development Goals

I'm trying out git/github as a way to track my professional development goals over time.  Let's see how this goes!

Originally structured as six-week/six-month/six-year goals my shorter-term goals are going to become 4-week/8-week goals to accommodate my professional development checkin schedule (i.e. since Dave and I meet once a month it's easier if goals/goal deadlines are on that same schedule).

I'm also just recently starting to add in `immediate #TODOs` as a way to think about professional development in a more day-to-day fashion.
