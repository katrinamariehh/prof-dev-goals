### things to think about when looking for goals to set (moved fromimmediate #TODOs)
* identify areas where I can improve i.e. if I pick up a card and can’t start it without help identify where the gaps in my knowledge are (related to the above learning vs. card work)
* take the gaps listed above as things to address on Fridays and start tracking as shorter-term goals
* keep an eye out for opportunities to go solo on card work especially if it requires new skills/technology for me i.e. if the card calls for something I’m really sure of, prefer to talk it over with a more senior developer, spend some time on my own, and then come back together to see how it’s going over going straight for pairing

_goals as of 24 July 2017; updated based on feedback from Wes at Dev/Partnerships retreat_

### immediate #TODOs
* spend Friday time working with Reagent/Clojurescript and Datomic--start by going back to work done with Dave on the retreat, but locate tutorials for each (I think I came across something called "Day of Datomic" that was a bunch of intro videos)
* make a list of potential project ideas to make something small with Reagent and Datomic--something helpful (personally or for DW) or something basic like a todo app if nothing comes up
* ~~(loosely) track time spent on card work vs. “learning” time related to card work i.e. if card work requires some time up-front to learn about whatever technology is being used that is the latter whereas a card that I can just pick up and start is the former~~

### eight weeks (due end of August 2017)
* get comfortable enough with Reagent and Datomic to jump in to Turbovote on next project rotation in September (outlined in immediate #TODOs)
* ~~set aside Friday time to start checking out the “place to start” web security thing--and also remember to look at this document on Fridays when there isn’t something I have explicitly planned to do _this could be helpful for stuff we're thinking about now on VIP re: security of the dashboard especially in relation to web-based file uploads_~~ _setting this aside for now--may be helpful in the future but I'd like to focus on Reagent and Datomic more immediately_
* ~~generate targeted SMART (Specific Measurable Achievable Relevant Time-boxed) goals around advancement to mid-level by the end of the year~~ _see goals re: Reagent and Datomic above_

### six months (due December 2017)
* progress into mid-level developer role

### six years (due 2023)
* consistently give back to the tech community in some kind of concrete way (attending meetups, seeking out opportunities to mentor women developers, facilitate *Bridge workshops)
* progressing into a senior level (without having to become a manager)

_here be dragons: aka here's older stuff before I started orienting my goals toward leveling up specifically

31 May 2017

### six weeks
* set aside Friday time to start checking out the “place to start” web security thing--and also remember to look at this document on Fridays when there isn’t something I have explicitly planned to do
* work on integrating professional development goals with day-to-day tasks - somewhat successful (see below)
* build a small web-app in clojure - of late I’ve been working with Troy on the new VIP project which is accomplishing a lot of this!!!!
* take an existing project (of my own, probably) and make it run with docker - I think I’ll squash this one--with the setting-up-a-new-project work I think I’m getting enough of what I was looking for without trying to do it from scratch on something else

### six months
* getting more comfortable with architecture of VIP projects in preparation to be the lead developer on the next rotation - I’ve been feeling quite comfortable with the role--sometimes the extra responsibilities make me nervous but I think I’m getting into it more and I like thinking about the project in broader terms as required by the role!
* get more comfortable with DW infrastructure - building the project that I’m currently working on is helping a lot with this
* learn more about web security?  Something I need to explore (take a look at this as a place to start? https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)

### six years
* run a ClojureBridge in Pittsburgh
* progress into a senior level (without having to become a manager)

3 May 2017
### six weeks
* work on integrating professional development goals with day-to-day tasks
* work through the Clojure Koans done
* build a small web-app in clojure – did not get to this yet, mostly prioritizing whatever I’m currently working on on Fridays
* find a topic to pitch for Strange Loop (open in April) decided against
* prepare a CFP for above talk decided against
* take an existing project (of my own, probably) and make it run with docker – did not get to this yet, I’ve spent most of my free time continuing on whatever I’m working on

### six months
* getting more comfortable with architecture of VIP projects in preparation to be the lead developer on the next rotation – I’ll be leading my first architecture meeting this week!
* have a talk prepared for conferences generally (targeted to Strange Loop, but other conferences as well) – while I’ve decided not to include this in my six week goals anymore, this may be something I still want to keep in mind in the next year or so
* get more comfortable with DW infrastructure
* deploy a side project (more about going through all the steps to deploy than about what I’m deploying)
* learn more about web security?  Something I need to explore (take a look at this as a place to start? https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)

22 March 2017
### six weeks
* work through the Clojure Koans – actively moving through, I think I have 6 or 7 files left → finished as of 3/31!
* build a small web-app in clojure – did not get to this yet, hoping to start once I’m done with the koans
* find a topic to pitch for Strange Loop (open in April) – attended a workshop last week on developing talk topics and writing CFPs
* spend x minutes/day brainstorming ideas
* figure out a good deadline to target for deciding
* I have some thoughts/ideas about potential topics but I have yet to hit on anything that *feels* right, but the workshop gave me a good framework for developing a topic once I have it
* prepare a CFP for above talk
* take an existing project (of my own, probably) and make it run with docker – did not get to this yet, I’ve spent most of my free time with the koans

### six months
* getting more comfortable with architecture of VIP projects in preparation to be the lead developer on the next rotation – this is going really well!  I’ve noticed lately I contribute more to VIP discussions and I think I’m getting a feel for the bigger picture in the project
* have a talk prepared for conferences generally (targeted to Strange Loop, but other conferences as well)
* get more comfortable with DW infrastructure
* deploy a side project (more about going through all the steps to deploy than about what I’m deploying)
* learn more about web security?  Something I need to explore

questions (for Dave/Wes):
* what does it look like to move from Junior to Mid-level at DW?  what kind of time-frame should I be looking at, what criteria do I need to meet to make the jump? –> Dave will check in with Wes and get back to me

#### tasks/chores/action items
* identify critical infrastructure/notes/details about VIP from Sean
* learn more about web security?
