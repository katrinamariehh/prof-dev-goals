_goals as of 28 June 2017_

### immediate #TODOs (to be assessed at end of July)
* (loosely) track time spent on card work vs. “learning” time related to card work i.e. if card work requires some time up-front to learn about whatever technology is being used that is the latter whereas a card that I can just pick up and start is the former
* identify areas where I can improve i.e. if I pick up a card and can’t start it without help identify where the gaps in my knowledge are (related to the above learning vs. card work)
* take the gaps listed above as things to address on Fridays and start tracking as shorter-term goals
* keep an eye out for opportunities to go solo on card work especially if it requires new skills/technology for me i.e. if the card calls for something I’m really sure of, prefer to talk it over with Troy, spend some time on my own, and then come back together to see how it’s going over going straight for pairing

### eight weeks (due end of August 2017)
* generate targeted SMART (Specific Measurable Achievable Relevant Time-boxed) goals around advancement to mid-level by the end of the year
* set aside Friday time to start checking out the “place to start” web security thing--and also remember to look at this document on Fridays when there isn’t something I have explicitly planned to do _this could be helpful for stuff we're thinking about now on VIP re: security of the dashboard especially in relation to web-based file uploads_

### six months (due December 2017)
* progress into mid-level developer role

### six years (due 2023)
* consistently give back to the tech community in some kind of concrete way (attending meetups, seeking out opportunities to mentor women developers, facilitate *Bridge workshops)
* progressing into a senior level (without having to become a manager)

_here be dragons: aka here's older stuff before I started orienting my goals toward leveling up specifically

31 May 2017

### six weeks
* set aside Friday time to start checking out the “place to start” web security thing--and also remember to look at this document on Fridays when there isn’t something I have explicitly planned to do
* work on integrating professional development goals with day-to-day tasks - somewhat successful (see below)
* build a small web-app in clojure - of late I’ve been working with Troy on the new VIP project which is accomplishing a lot of this!!!!
* take an existing project (of my own, probably) and make it run with docker - I think I’ll squash this one--with the setting-up-a-new-project work I think I’m getting enough of what I was looking for without trying to do it from scratch on something else

### six months
* getting more comfortable with architecture of VIP projects in preparation to be the lead developer on the next rotation - I’ve been feeling quite comfortable with the role--sometimes the extra responsibilities make me nervous but I think I’m getting into it more and I like thinking about the project in broader terms as required by the role!
* get more comfortable with DW infrastructure - building the project that I’m currently working on is helping a lot with this
* learn more about web security?  Something I need to explore (take a look at this as a place to start? https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)

### six years
* run a ClojureBridge in Pittsburgh
* progress into a senior level (without having to become a manager)

3 May 2017
### six weeks
* work on integrating professional development goals with day-to-day tasks
* work through the Clojure Koans done
* build a small web-app in clojure – did not get to this yet, mostly prioritizing whatever I’m currently working on on Fridays
* find a topic to pitch for Strange Loop (open in April) decided against
* prepare a CFP for above talk decided against
* take an existing project (of my own, probably) and make it run with docker – did not get to this yet, I’ve spent most of my free time continuing on whatever I’m working on

### six months
* getting more comfortable with architecture of VIP projects in preparation to be the lead developer on the next rotation – I’ll be leading my first architecture meeting this week!
* have a talk prepared for conferences generally (targeted to Strange Loop, but other conferences as well) – while I’ve decided not to include this in my six week goals anymore, this may be something I still want to keep in mind in the next year or so
* get more comfortable with DW infrastructure
* deploy a side project (more about going through all the steps to deploy than about what I’m deploying)
* learn more about web security?  Something I need to explore (take a look at this as a place to start? https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)

22 March 2017
### six weeks
* work through the Clojure Koans – actively moving through, I think I have 6 or 7 files left → finished as of 3/31!
* build a small web-app in clojure – did not get to this yet, hoping to start once I’m done with the koans
* find a topic to pitch for Strange Loop (open in April) – attended a workshop last week on developing talk topics and writing CFPs
* spend x minutes/day brainstorming ideas
* figure out a good deadline to target for deciding
* I have some thoughts/ideas about potential topics but I have yet to hit on anything that *feels* right, but the workshop gave me a good framework for developing a topic once I have it
* prepare a CFP for above talk
* take an existing project (of my own, probably) and make it run with docker – did not get to this yet, I’ve spent most of my free time with the koans

### six months
* getting more comfortable with architecture of VIP projects in preparation to be the lead developer on the next rotation – this is going really well!  I’ve noticed lately I contribute more to VIP discussions and I think I’m getting a feel for the bigger picture in the project
* have a talk prepared for conferences generally (targeted to Strange Loop, but other conferences as well)
* get more comfortable with DW infrastructure
* deploy a side project (more about going through all the steps to deploy than about what I’m deploying)
* learn more about web security?  Something I need to explore

questions (for Dave/Wes):
* what does it look like to move from Junior to Mid-level at DW?  what kind of time-frame should I be looking at, what criteria do I need to meet to make the jump? –> Dave will check in with Wes and get back to me

#### tasks/chores/action items
* identify critical infrastructure/notes/details about VIP from Sean
* learn more about web security?
